Documentation including installation instructions and tutorial can be 
found in the Personis/Doc directory.

Open the file Personis/Doc/Personis.pdf for installation instructions 
and tutorials. 

For the impatient, you can install Personis by typing the command "./install.sh" 
in the top level directory. You will get copious output from python as it installs
packages.

The install.sh script should work but it assumes you have Berkeley DB installed on your system.
If not, there is a copy of the source in the top level directory and you will need to install it
according to the directions, and then run install.sh again.
